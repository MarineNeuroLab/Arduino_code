# Arduino code
 Code for various Arduino projects. 
 Some code is finished and ready to use (these typically have a fritzing diagram to show wiring) and some is still work in progress. 
 
### Using LEDs
| Folder                            | Description  |
|:----------------------------------|:-------------|
| BlinkAll                          | turn on one or more LEDs at the same time |
| BlinkAndFadeInTurn                | turn on and fade out one or more LEDs in turn |
| BlinkInTurn                       | as BlinkAndFadeInTurn but without fading |
| BlinkInTurn10                     | as BlinkInTurn but for 10 LEDs |
| BlinkInTurnIndividualBrightness   | as BlinkAndFadeInTurn but specifying the brightness for each LED individually |
| BlinkOnce                         | blink a single LED |
| LEDcalibration                    | work in progress |
| LEDsON                            | turn on one or more LEDs and leave them on |
| LEDsONindividualBrightess         | turn on one or more LEDs and leave them with each LEDs brightness set individually|
| OneLEDon                          | turn on one LEDs and leave it on |

 ### Using a vibration motor
