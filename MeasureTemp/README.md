# Temperature measurements

Use this Arduino sketch to measure the temperature in Celsius from a DS18B20 temperature sensor. 

The code is based on [these instructions](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/guide-for-ds18b20-temperature-sensor-with-arduino/).


## Requirements
 Two contributed Arduino libraries need to be installed (follow [these instructions](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) to do so):

- **OneWire** by *Paul Stoffregen* (version 2.3.5 used here)
- **DallasTemperature** by *Miles Burton* (version 3.9.0 used here)
